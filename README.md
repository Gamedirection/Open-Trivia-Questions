# Open-Trivia Question Collections

This repo hosts **shareable category packs** for Open‑Trivia.

## How It Works
- Each category is packaged as a zip with:
  - `questions.csv`
  - optional `images/` folder
- The app can import a repo zip directly (or a per‑category zip).

Browse collections at `questions.trivia.gamedirection.net`.
